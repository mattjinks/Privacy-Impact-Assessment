# Privacy Impact Assessment

This project was completed on a team of four for CS-4726: Privacy Technology, Policy, & Law at Georgia Tech.

## Overview
Our goal is to make a case for stronger legal privacy protection for North Carolina residents by analyzing the stateâ€™s publicly available voting records, provided by the North Carolina State Board of Elections (NCSBE). To achieve this, we assessed legal compliance and privacy risks, identifying vulnerabilities and misalignment with federal and state regulations including the Help America Vote Act. Based on our findings, we developed and recommended privacy-enhancing policies to the NCSBE focusing on data security, access controls, and voter integrity.
